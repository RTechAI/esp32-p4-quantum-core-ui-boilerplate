# ForgeUI One Boiler Plate

**Hardware-proven single-page LVGL v9 UI boilerplate for ESP32-P4 touchscreen projects.**

Built natively using **ESP32-P4 UI Studio (ForgeUI Studio)**, this project provides a complete firmware baseline ready to build, flash, modify, and extend for real embedded products.

> **Create once. Export once. Flash once. Build real products.**

Current validated hardware:

- Waveshare ESP32-P4-WIFI6-Touch-LCD-7B (1024×600)
- ESP-IDF v5.5.x
- LVGL v9

# About This Boiler Plate

This repository is one of the official **ForgeUI One Boiler Plates**.

Each boilerplate contains:

- Complete ESP-IDF project structure
- Production-ready ForgeUI One runtime
- Professionally designed single-page **Cyberpunk Nexus** HMI
- Hardware-proven embedded runtime
- Clean, zero-bloat starting point for your own applications

Simply clone, build, flash, customise, and create your own embedded product.

# Why Boiler Plates?

Every ForgeUI Boiler Plate is a complete, hardware-proven embedded application showcasing a different user interface, design style, and embedded workflow.

Rather than starting from an empty ESP-IDF project, developers can clone a Boiler Plate, customise the interface, and immediately begin building their own embedded products.

Each Boiler Plate demonstrates the capabilities of **ESP32-P4 UI Studio** while providing a production-ready **ForgeUI One** runtime.

# Built With ESP32-P4 UI Studio

This project was visually designed and exported using the open-source **ESP32-P4 UI Studio** desktop application.

Repository:

https://github.com/RTechAI/esp32p4-ui-studio

ESP32-P4 UI Studio provides:

- Visual UI Designer & Canvas Builder
- AI-assisted prompt-to-layout generation
- AI Hero Theme generation
- Theme Manager
- Asset Manager
- Icon Browser
- LVGL v9 code generation
- Standalone ESP-IDF project export
- Direct deployment to ForgeUI One

# Powered by ForgeUI One

ForgeUI One is the embedded runtime powering every exported project from **ESP32-P4 UI Studio**.

Repository:

https://github.com/RTechAI/ForgeUI-One

It provides:

- ESP-IDF project structure
- LVGL v9 runtime
- EK79007 MIPI-DSI display integration
- GT911 capacitive touch support
- ESP-Hosted WiFi integration
- DS3231 RTC support
- SD Card support
- Audio subsystem support
- Theme management
- Modular runtime architecture
- Generated UI integration

Generated UI layouts are automatically inserted into the runtime and rendered directly on physical ESP32-P4 hardware.

# Why ForgeUI One?

Rather than beginning with a blank ESP-IDF project, ForgeUI One provides a stable, reusable, hardware-proven foundation allowing developers to focus on building applications instead of low-level hardware integration.

Every ForgeUI One Boiler Plate includes:

- Hardware-proven runtime
- Clean modular architecture
- Stable LVGL execution
- Reusable graphical components
- Single-page HMI templates
- Production-ready project structure
